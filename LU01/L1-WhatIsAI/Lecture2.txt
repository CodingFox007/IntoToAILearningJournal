Algorithm: output can be determined
AI: output cannot be determined
Big data: data sets too large to be processed by traditional applications
Context Window: Max number of tokens (words or parts of words) that can be processed. essentially the memory.
Emergent behavior: Behavior that was unexpected
hallucination: When large language models generate factually inaccurate/illogical answers due to data constraints
Prompt engineering: Designing effective prompts to get better results
AI temperature: Lower value, more focused, higher value, more creative
